Welcome to Hydra Ecosystem’s project page for  [Season of Docs 2020](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs)!

We are excited for this opportunity to welcome technical writers to our open source community and help them gain experience in contributing docs to open source projects. 

Our goal for this collaboration is to improve the onboarding experience for new developers, thereby making it easy for them to start contributing to the project.

## What we are looking for

*Skills*: 

Self-motivation, collaboration, and a willingness to learn are crucial skills for a tech writer. We expect the tech writer to demonstrate these skills by proactive participation in the weekly Slack standups, engaging with our Slack community, and being receptive to guidance. We are aware that contributing to a technical project can be daunting and overwhelming and we are here to help you out in any way we can.

*Time commitments*: 

The Season of Docs official website [states](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/faq#how_much_time_does_participation_take) that the tech writer is expected to put in 20-30 hours per week on average. While we think that's a fair expectation, we are open to discussing the time estimates for the selected project.

### Tech writer’s takeaways:

This project will help you develop the following technical writing skills:

- Conducting technical research
- Gathering information from SMEs
- Drafting and editing technical content
- Getting reviews and incorporating feedback
- Publishing technical docs
- Using GitHub and Markdown

## Documentation project plan
Following is the project plan and timeline we want to adhere to:
*Community bonding period (August 17 - September 13):*
- Get to know the mentors, the project, the users, and the community.
- From a technical writing perspective, you will conduct self-study and research, user-test the project, analyze the audience, and learn basic GitHub workflows and Markdown syntax.
- By the end of this phase, you should be familiar with the project and the audience and determine the best documentation type for the project.

*Doc development phase 1* (September 14 - October 13):
- Complete remainining user-testing and audience analysis (if any)
- Write the first drafts of the deliverables.

*Doc development phase 2* (October 14 - November 30):
- Edit the drafts for technical and grammatical correctness, conciseness, clarity, and style consistency
- Ask for and incorporate technical, editorial, and peer review feedback
- Publish the deliverables

## Meet the team
**Technical mentors**: [Akshay Dahiya](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xadahiya/), [Chris Andrew](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrizandr/), [Lorenzo Moriondo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lorenzomoriondo/)

### Tips for writing a good proposal
- Carefully read all the guides in the "For Technical Writers" section on the Season of Docs website: [https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/docs/tech-writer-guide)
- Select a project idea from the section below or propose your own project. Feel free to contact us over Slack to discuss your project idea(s) and gauge their viability.
- Write the proposal! Your proposal is not only a communication medium for your project idea but also a demonstration of your documentation skills. Make sure your proposal is clear, concise, comprehensive, and grammatically correct.


## Project Ideas

Here are a few ideas to get the discussion started but feel free to propose your own ideas!

## 1. Refactoring of Documentation.

### Project Description:

The porject documentation for the tools developed by Hydra Ecosystem is scattered around many links and resources. We need a centralized documentation system and a documentation workflow that is regularly updated by contributors as the project further progresses. We already have readthedocs documentation for our major tools. These documents need to be improved with updations and proper references. We need a centralized location linking the documentation from individual project documents, preferably hosted on our current website. This project involves updating the documentation and of our major tools and refactoring it to be more easily accesible. We need to refactor the existing information to provide a conceptual and architectural overview of each project. The overview needs to be user-friendly and (as far as possible) jargon-free and should include real-world use-cases of the project. This might be a large undertaking and we would be open to extending this project into a long term one based on the proposals.


*Resources:*

Currently, the conceptual and architectural overview of the project is scattered across the following documents/articles:

- [Homepage](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/00-Home)
- [Chris' blog](https://gsocchrizandr.wordpress.com/the-book-of-hydrus/)
- [Akshay's blog](https://www.xadahiya.me/Hydrus-in-detail/)

- [Client](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/heracles_explained)
- [Building Next-Generation Web APIs](https://youtu.be/tRTD2W4W8G4)

 
## 2. Improve the "Get Involved" experience for new contributors

### Project Description:

As the project evolves through the pre-alpha and alpha phases, we would like to generate interest among developers/users for the purpose of testing initially and eventually adoption. We need a guide to help contributors set up the testing environment and know what workflows/use-cases to test. This guide could also include contribution guidelines (how to open issues, whom to assign issues to, how to open PRs, and so on). Another addition that we would like to have as part of this project are tutorials and code examples to help users inderstand the inner workings of each tool. The basic gist is to make people easier understand the tools and code so it is easier to contribute.

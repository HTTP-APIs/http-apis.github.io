## Analysis of Heracles.ts 

HydraClient, also known as Heracles.ts, is a generic client for Hydra-powered Web APIs. You can find the code at this repository [here](https://github.com/HydraCG/Heracles.ts).

### Client Part in Hydra 

The basic idea behind Hydra is to provide a vocabulary which enables a server to advertise valid state transitions to a client. A client can then use this information to construct HTTP requests which modify the serverâ€™s state so that a certain desired goal is achieved. Since all the information about the valid state transitions is exchanged in a machine-processable way at runtime instead of being hardcoded into the client at design time, clients can be decoupled from the server and adapt to changes more easily.

Heracles.ts defines mainly two type of Index:

* Classes
* Interface

and it also contain a variable called `hydra` like `hydra:{any_string("http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/core#")}`.



### Components Of Client 

Classes are further divides in:
* `HydraClient`
* `ApiDocumentation`
* `JsonLdHypermediaProcessor`
* `ResourceEnrichmentProvider`

Interface are divided in:
* `IClass`
* `IApiDocumentation`
* `IHydraResource`
* `IHypermedia`
* `IHypermediaContainer`
* `IHypermediaProcessor`
* `IOperation`
* `IResource`
* `IWebResource`

Classes of Client are the implementation of the Interfaces, there are so many interfaces like `IProperty`, `IOperation` and etc. And there is a folder Collection which contain the implementation of all collection interface like `FilterableCollection`, `LinkCollection` and `OperationCollection` where `FilterableCollection` returns numbers of items in collection, members of collection, and `LinkCollection` returns the collection of link for given type, and `OperationCollection` returns the operations for given type and so on. So, that's client have functionality to shows the operation, members, no. of items, links and type, etc. for a given resource.

For example, an interface for Collection is `IHypermediaContainer` which have the track for members, operation, links for a given type of collection.

For Classes, `IClass` simply have `displayname`, `description`, `supportedOperation` and `supportedProperty` as attributes. For `supportedOperation` there is an interface `IOperation` which returns methods for operations; for `supportedProperty` there is an interface `ISupportedProperty` which have properties like `writeable`, `readable`. While properties can contain one more interface in them: `IProperty` which able to return display name, description and other properties. 


### Design Patters of Client 

#### Design for HydraClient Class:

HydraClient is using for getting `Url`, `ApiDocumentationUrl`, and after that `ApiDocumentation` and also to check if an entrypoint exists or not. It simply works with the `IHyadraClient` interface which working to obtain `ApiDocumentation`, representation of `Resource`.

HydraClient methods(simply functions):
* `getApiDocumentation`
* `getApiDocumentationUrl`
* `getHypermediaProcessor`
* `getResource`
* `getUrl`

#### Design for ApiDocumentation Class:

`ApiDocumentation` is used to assign values to properties or variables like `type`, `title`, `description`, `supportedClasses`, `Entrypoint` etc. `ApiDocumentation` is the default implementation of `IApiDocumentation`.

`ApiDocumentation` methods and properties:
* `getEntrypoint`
* `type`
* `title`
* `description`
* `supportedClass`
* `entrypoint`

#### Design for JsonLdHypermediaProcessor Class:

`JsonLdHypermediaProcessor` is a JSON-LD based implementation of `IHypermediaProcessor`.

`JsonLdHypermediaProcessor` methods and properties:
* `supportedMediaTypes`
* `process`
others are private methods.

#### Design for ResourceEnrichmentProvider Class:

`ResourceEnrichmentProvider` provides `IWebResource` enrichment routines. It enriches a given resource with `IHypermediaContainer` specific properties with method `enrichHypermedia`.

`ResourceEnrichmentProvider` methods:
* `enrichHypermedia`

Actually, there are many interfaces which have track on the objects as well as its properties as we have disussed above and with the implementation of the interface (called Class above) means accessing the members or properties of interface for whom  client can get a lot of knowledge about the starting url or server.

Load on server and speed can be limitation for the client. But in [python-hydra-agent](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs/python-hydra-agent)  we are dicsussing mainly about how to reduce the load on server and fast querying from the client. For this type of problem, we are using Redis to reduce load of server and we can implement indexing (specially secondary/faceted indexing) of objects and their properties in Redis with a good querying mechanism which can make operations faster and efficient.

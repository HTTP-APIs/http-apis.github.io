# Project Ideas

## Writing the conceptual and architectural overviews for the project

### Project Description:

Currently, the conceptual and architectural overview of the project is scattered across the following documents/articles:

- [Chris' blog](https://gsocchrizandr.wordpress.com/the-book-of-hydrus/)
- [Akshay's blog](https://www.xadahiya.me/Hydrus-in-detail/)
- [Homepage](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/00-Home)
- [Usage](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/01-Usage)
- [Workflow](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/Workflow)
- [Auth](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/Auth)
- [Client](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/heracles_explained)
- [Building Next-Generation Web APIs](https://youtu.be/tRTD2W4W8G4)

We need to refactor the existing information to provide a conceptual and architectural overview of the project. The overview needs to be user-friendly and (as far as possible) jargon-free and should include real-world use-cases of the project. 

### Tech writer’s takeaways:

This project will allow you to demonstrate the following technical writing skills:

- Conducting technical research
- Gathering information from SMEs
- Drafting and editing technical tutorials
- Getting reviews and incorporating feedback
- Publishing technical docs


## Creating a `Get Involved` document

### Project Description:

As the project evolves through the pre-alpha and alpha phases, we would like to generate interest among developers/users for the purpose of testing initially and eventually adoption. We need a guide to help contributors set up the testing environment and know what workflows/use-cases to test. This guide could also include contribution guidelines (how to open issues, whom to assign issues to, how to open PRs, and so on).
The information in the following documents can be used to create this guide:

- https://www.xadahiya.me/Hydrus-in-detail/
- https://www.xadahiya.me/Finishing-up/
- https://www.xadahiya.me/Phase2/
- [Workflow](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/Workflow)
- [Usage](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/01-Usage)
- [Auth](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/Auth)
- [Example](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/Example)
- [Client](https://www.hydraecosystem.org/heracles_explained)

### Tech writer’s takeaways:

This project will allow you to demonstrate the following technical writing skills:

- Conducting technical research
- Gathering information from SMEs
- Drafting and editing technical tutorials
- Getting reviews and incorporating feedback
- Publishing technical docs

## Improving the UX of the doc site 

### Project Description:

The current site design and information architecture can be improved in the following ways:

- Currently, https://www.hydraecosystem.org/ serves as the landing page. But the lack of a sidebar/topbar nav makes it difficult to navigate the content. Implementing a navigation bar would solve this problem.
- The API docs (https://hydrus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hydrus.html#submodules) need to be linked from the main site. If time permits, the API docs can be restructured to make them user-friendly.
- The existing pages from different authors can be edited to make the content flow better and appear more homogeneous in the style of writing. 

### Tech writer's takeaways:
This project will help you learn and demonstrate your documentation tooling, information architecture, and UX design skills.

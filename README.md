# Hydra Ecosystem Documentation

This is the source-code behind [hydraecosystem.org](https://hydraecosystem.org), the official documentation of the Hydra Ecosystem toolset.

## Viewing the documentation offline

The documentation is hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) and uses the static site generator named [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). If you want to see what your modifications to the documentation would look like, before you make a PR, please run the following commands:

- Check if you have Jekyll installed. if not, follow the [installation guide](https://jekyllrb.com/docs)
```bash
jekyll -v
```
- Start a live-server which serves statically generated content, changes made will make real-time changes to it.
```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

*Note:* Just running the `jekyll` command without any arguments, might build a static website in html form with-in the `public` directory, please make sure not to include this in your PR.

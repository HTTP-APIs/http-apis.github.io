**Hydra** is a documentation framework that bases on top of established **Linked Data** (Semantic Web) tools to build the next generation of connected Web APIs. The team of developers in the *HTTP-APIs* community aims to establish an ecosystem of tools to make Hydra framework operational. A list of tools under development can be found [at this link](https://github.com/HTTP-APIs).

Hydra is currently a draft created by [**World Wide Web Consortium's Hydra Community Group**](https://www.w3.org/community/hydra/). Official documentation available [here](http://hydra-cg.com) and development is open [here](https://github.com/HydraCG).

**Hydra Ecosystem** promotes and facilitates the adoption of Hydra.
